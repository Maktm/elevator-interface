# Elevator interface

## Introduction

## Current design

Issues with the current design:

* Difficult to tell the differences between S1, S2, ..., S5
* Difficult to determine which floor a book is on
* Interface does not show that elevator is disabled in the event of a fire
* Add feature to unselect a floor to go to (unavailable on most elevators)
* Add activity feature at the bottom to show how busy the library is
